## Results obtained in this practice

In this practice I have implemented a function in order to solve the **Rosalind's rabbits** problem.
This program have to implement *Fibonacci's succesion* according to the a number of *months* and *pairs*.
The main objetive of this practice is to create *unitary tests*, in this case, I have implemented these tests before the *fibonacci's* function.

This unitary tests have thrown the following results:

1. Coverage of **proyecto total**: 92.8 %
2. Coverage of **main** : 100 %
3. Coverage of **test**: 89.9 %
